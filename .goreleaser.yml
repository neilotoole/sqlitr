    summary: "Trivial SQLite query tool to demonstrate neilotoole/xcgo"
    description: |
      sqlitr is a trivial query tool for SQLite. It was created as a demonstration for neilotoole/xcgo, which is a Go cross-compiling docker builder image.

    # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
    # it is ready.
    # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
    # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
    # channels. More info about channels here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels
    grade: devel

    # Snaps can be setup to follow three different confinement policies:
    # `strict`, `devmode` and `classic`. A strict confinement where the snap
    # can only read and write in its own namespace is recommended. Extra
    # permissions for strict snaps can be declared as `plugs` for the app, which
    # are explained later. More info about confinement here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/confinement
